# Electronic Medical Record

Developed an accessible, voice-enabled electronic medical record system which stores patientsâ€™ medical records, and allows patients to fill out medical forms using speech-to-text. Our theme while building it was accessibility, hence the voice control integration, simple and easy to understand UI, and big, bold colours.

This project was inspired by Leon's father's first-hand experience with a lack of electronic medical records and realizing the need for more accessible patient experience.

## How It Is Built

The front end is built on react-native, while the backend is built in node.js using MongoDB Atlas as our database. The backend was deployed on a Heroku instance also. For our speed to text processing, we used the Google Cloud Platform. We also used Twilio for our SMS reminder component.
